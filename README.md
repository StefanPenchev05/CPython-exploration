# Python-C Integration Learning Repository

This repository is dedicated to learning Python and exploring its implementation in C (CPython). The goal is to understand the Python language from a high-level perspective and dive deep into its internals, including how Python code is executed by the CPython interpreter.

## Contents

- **docs/**: Documentation and learning notes.
  - **overview.md**: High-level overview of Python and its internals.
  - **python_basics.md**: Basic Python syntax and features.
  - **cpython_internals.md**: Detailed exploration of CPython internals.
  - **c_interaction.md**: How Python interacts with C and how to extend/modify Python using C.

- **src/**: Source code for examples and experiments.
  - **python_examples/**: Python scripts demonstrating various features.
    - **basic_syntax/**: Examples of basic Python syntax.
    - **advanced_features/**: Examples of advanced Python features.
    - **projects/**: Larger projects to apply Python knowledge.
  - **c_examples/**: C code related to Python internals and extensions.
    - **cpython_extensions/**: Writing Python extensions in C.
    - **embedding_python/**: Embedding Python in C applications.
    - **performance_tuning/**: Performance optimization using C.

- **tests/**: Unit tests for the examples and experiments.
  - **python_tests/**: Tests for Python scripts.
  - **c_tests/**: Tests for C code.

- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for interactive learning and analysis.
  - **python_tutorials.ipynb**: Step-by-step Python tutorials.
  - **cpython_analysis.ipynb**: Analysis of CPython internals.

## Getting Started

To start learning, explore the `docs/` directory and follow along with the examples in `src/`. Use the Jupyter notebooks in `notebooks/` for interactive learning.
